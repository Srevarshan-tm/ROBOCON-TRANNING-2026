## üöÄ Roadmap ‚Äì From Simulation to Hardware

1. **Simulation Stage (Tinkercad):**

   * Learn and test circuits safely online.
   * Debug Arduino code before real-world deployment.

2. **Hardware Stage (Arduino + Components):**

   * Transfer code to Arduino Uno using Arduino IDE.
   * Assemble the same circuits on a breadboard or PCB.

3. **Robocon Training Stage:**

   * Combine multiple modules (sensors + motors + logic).
   * Develop full robotics systems (omniwhell robot, obstacle avoidance).
