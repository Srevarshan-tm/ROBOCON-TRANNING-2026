Hi, I’m Sre Varshan, an Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE – Cyber Physical Systems) student.
I’m passionate about robotics, embedded systems, and programming, and I’m currently training for Robocon 2026.

This repository is my learning and practice space, where I document:

Arduino projects (simulated on Tinkercad)

Robotics prototypes (sensors, actuators, motor drivers)

Code snippets for training and testing

Step-by-step progress in Robocon preparation
